## Deploy an IPFS site

1. Checkout the [examples](examples/README.md) to find and update a template that you like.
2. Once you've finished with your site, you can deploy to pinata by using our deploy script or another IPFS tool like (ipfs-deploy)[https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/ipfs-deploy]
3. Once you've gotten your IPFS hash attach it to your domain
