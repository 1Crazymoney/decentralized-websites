# Examples

This folder contains all of the current templates available on [Unstoppable Domains](https://unstoppabledomains.com/)

## Using Unstoppable Domains templates

In the `ud-static-templates` directory you will find all of the templates available on the Unstoppable Domains website builder feature. In the `index.html` files for each template directory you will find comments pointing to the items we allow for updating in the website builder.

**Notes**

- The inline CSS styles are the options available to update in the website builder
- SVG Icons are inlined so that colors can be updated

## Using JS Frameworks

> Hosting a website on IPFS is slightly different than hosting it on a web server out in the cloud. Your website may require a little bit of tweaking in order to properly be served on the IPFS network.
>
> The important rules are:
>
> - All of the content for your website must be contained in one build folder, with an index.html file.
> - All links within your files should be relative links.
